##### I would like the default node shape for all new maps to be 'bubble' rather than 'fork'. [Source](https://sourceforge.net/p/freeplane/discussion/758437/thread/c220ae649f/)

* Choose the menu: Format, Manage Styles, Edit Styles

* In the map than appears on the screen change the "Default" node appearance (shape, color, text...).

```In all next new maps```
If you whant to change it in all maps you create open the standard mindmap template (it is: <freeplane_dir>/resources/templates/standard-1.6.mm) and change the Default style as in the previous way. Save the template.

Its better to create a new template for your maps:
1. Open a new map
2. Change all styles you want
3. Create all new styles you want (Format, Manage Styles, New Styles from selection)
4. Create all nodes you whant to appear in the new maps.
5. Save the map
6. Open the user directory (Tools, Open User Directory)
7. Copy the new map to the templates directory of the User Directory.
8. Open Freeplane preferences (Tools / Preferences)
9. In the Environmente tab, Files section, change the Standard template file to the new map you created.
