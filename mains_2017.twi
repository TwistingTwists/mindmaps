yet we can proudly claim India as successful model of democracy in third world.republicConclusion:india progressively moving towards achievement of goals in Preamble.Has new Economic Policy, 1991 reduced Socialistic nature of India state?

in this light, what considerations need to be kept in mind to make New Economic policy, 2019 ?democractic socialism = weakenedDefine Indian Secularism.

evaluate nature of India as secular state.secularism:

separate of state from religion

[europe secularism] religious neutrality = state indifference from religion of individual

Religious freedom i.e. freedom of conscienceprincipled distance :

 not necessarily equal treatment. Different principles for different religion.State can interfere in Hindu religious institutions but left others.Special rights to minority :

29,30positive secularism :

promoting spirit Communal harmonySR Bommai Case, 1994 : Secularim is basic structure of constitutionarguments can be put against status of India as a secular state?Indian secularism has been debatable concept.

elusive conceptthus status of India as a secular state is contested. however there is no question mark on constitutional principle.

SR Bommai case, SC held secularism as basic structure.

Certain anomalies in practice are natural in a diverse society like India in which religion plays prominent role in life of persons. Yet we can say that gradually we will be able to end such anomalies.secularism is all about creating a wall of separation between state and religion , thus devaluing religion.

Critically analyse statement in Indian context.secularism is a contested concept. (various definitions)wall between state nad religion:

even in west, separate

other meaning - equidistance, religious freedom,

indian context - multi layered conceptImpact of

phenomenon of increasing use of caste and religion

Unhealthy impact of such practices =  polarisation, communalism, populist policies,  question on secular nature


RPA - 123(3) explain

SC interpretation on HIS

Impact on Indian secularism

conclude123(3) : religion , caste cannot appeal to voter
=> corrupt practiceStrengthen secularism ? : NOseems purposive interpretation +  leading to discrimination against other religioncaste representation is important for strengthening character of Indian societySecularism in Indian context has been embedded in

equality
, democracy
, human dignity.democracy - systems aims to protect human dignitysecularism - special rights to minorities (29,30) in democracy[conclusion]

though often called as pseudo secularism, it is based on idea of human dignity.

indian model eerged out of historical context of partition where ensuring dignity to minorities was important.
